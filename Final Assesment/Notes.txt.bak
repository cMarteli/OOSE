/** poll() method - incoming messages **/

// program must call poll() to receive comms from responders
// will return all comms received since last called
// will usually be empty or have one string but may have multiple
//eg. flood rescuers arrive in midtown
	flood + Midtown
//eg2. chemical cleanup crews have left Westtown
	chemical - Westtown
// format: ('+' means arrival a '-' means departure) (.+ means any string. it's for the location)
	end|(fire|flood|chemical) [+-] .+
// a special string containing the word "end" can be sent also
//eg3.
	end
// this notifies the entire simulation to shut down
// any invalid message should be logged without stopping the sim


/** send() method - status events **/

// notifies responders of events in the simulation
//eg. flood in Midtown is over
	flood end Midtown
//eg2. fire in Hill Valley is now low-intensity
	fire low Hill Valley
// format: (low and high are only for fires) (.+ means any string. it's for the location)
	(fire|flood|chemical) (start|end|low|high) .+

// Loss Events - (Hospitalization, Propert dmg or environmental contamination)
//eg. New Person hospitalized due fire in Midtown, injury tally is now 2 (this event)
fire casualty 2 Midtown
//eg2. New Property damaged due to flood in Hill valley, prprty dmg tally is now 3 (this event)


TODO:

store time each responder is on the job
make so user is informed when jobs end
add the ability for events to increase in size or dissipate

remember:
-use logger
-periodically check with PMD linting tool "./gradlew check"
