1. Multiplicity

(a)
	private City cities[], private Government govt, private Industry industry.
(b)
	We use a map due to it's indexing benefits which allow searches to be perfomed at O(1)
	instead of using iteration O(n) also we can refer to the objects using keys instead of having to
	get the variable label every time.
	The map for City objects could be type Map<String, City> city name and Object
	The map for industry could be Map<String, Industry> industry name(label) and Object.

(c)
	You could use setPopulation() to add the population values of each city and return a value
	for the total nation population then store it.
	getPopulation could be used to return that variable.

(d)
	getPartyName()
	getOppositionName()
	getTotalExport()


2. Maps

(a)
	getProperties()
	setProperties()
(b)
	You cannot rename an object key is hashMap java.
	Best way is to remove the element and add a new one with updated key:
	
	properties.put( "newAddress", properties.remove("oldAdress") );


3. Gotcha:ConcurrentModificationException
